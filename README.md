# Toffee Shop E-commerce Website

## Overview
Toffee Shop is an e-commerce website developed using C# that allows the online sale of various candies. This project utilizes a JSON-based database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## How It Works

### Customer Module
- Customers can register and log in to the website using their credentials for secure access.
- Upon login, customers can browse through the available candies and add them to their shopping cart.
- The shopping cart allows customers to modify quantities, remove items, and proceed to the checkout page.
- Customers can search for specific candies by name, category, or price range to find desired products.
- Detailed product descriptions, including images, prices, and customer reviews, are provided to help customers make informed decisions.
- The website integrates a payment gateway to facilitate secure online transactions.

### Admin Module
- Administrators can log in to the system with their authorized credentials.
- A role-based access control system ensures that administrators have access to relevant functionalities.
- The intuitive admin dashboard allows administrators to manage products, categories, and customer orders.
- Administrators can add new candies to the inventory, update existing products, and remove items as needed.
- The inventory management feature enables administrators to track stock availability and receive automated notifications for low stock levels.
- Comprehensive sales reports and analytics are generated to provide insights into the performance of the online store.

### Database Management
- The database for Toffee Shop is implemented using simple JSON files.
- The JSON files store all the necessary data for products, categories, customer information, and orders.
- At the start of the program, the system automatically loads the JSON database to retrieve existing data.
- Any changes made during the program's execution, such as adding new products, updating categories, or processing customer orders, are automatically saved to the JSON files before program termination.
